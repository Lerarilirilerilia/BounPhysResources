PHYS301 Lecture notes. You can add your notes from previous or current semester. 
If the semester folder doesn't exist, just create it. 
If someone already uploaded lecture notes for the semester you want to contribute, 
you can create a subfolder for your notes under your name or pseudonym.

Ex.: 
PHYS301/Lecture Notes/FALL24/Cheescakes-Notes/
PHYS301/Lecture Notes/FALL24/JohnDoes-Notes/
