# RULES AND GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTING TO THIS REPO

1. Textbook recommendations are to be added to `Textbook Recommendations.md` files under course directory. 
2. Try to be descriptive with file names etc.
3. Don't directly upload large pdfs (includes textbooks with a public license)
    
If you don't know how to contribute to a public github repo here is a [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project). It is fairly easy, so please don't get discouraged.
