# 📜 Rules and Guidelines for Contributing to This Repo

1. 📚 Textbook recommendations are to be added to `Textbook Recommendations.md` files under the course directory. 
2. ✍️ Try to be descriptive with file names, etc. so people can navigate the repository easier
3. 🚫 Don't directly upload large PDFs (including textbooks with a public license). Github has a storage limit for each repository. So please provide drive links under a Markdown/Text file for large pdfs.
    
If you don't know how to contribute to a public GitHub repo, here is a helpful [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project). It is fairly easy, but if you still have problems, open an issue or e-mail/text me personally.
